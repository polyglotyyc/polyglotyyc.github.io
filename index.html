      <h1>Vision</h1>
      <p>
        Polyglot: knowing or using several languages. This event is inspired by
        the
        <a href="https://www.polyglotconf.com/" target="_blank"
          >Polyglot Unconference</a
        >
        in Vancouver. We hope to gather 100 Calgary software developers who will
        leave language, platform and possibly even editor wars behind and come
        together for a spontaneously organized day of amazing talks, round-table
        discussions, panel sessions, and coding.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you've never been to an unconference (or open-space) event before,
        you owe it to yourself to make it to Polyglot YYC 2024. It's an
        experience like no other.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why $20 tickets? From our experience, we see a larger drop off rate for
        free events. Any proceeds after costs (catering breakfast and lunch,
        security, etc.) will be donated to the

      <h1>Who are we?</h1>
      <p>
        Polyglot YYC isn't the product of some faceless corporation looking to
        make a buck by getting you to a conference and then selling you a
        time-share. The organizers are all community members from around
        Calgary: just like you! We saw a lot of user groups for Ruby, Python,
        functional languages, .net, etc. but very few places where developers
        from different communities could get together. We hope that Polyglot YYC
        will be that place: a place for technologists to get together and talk
        about the craft.
      </p>

      <h1>Talks</h1>
      <p>
        Open-space unconferences are spontaneously scheduled and 100%
        attendee-driven. Sessions will be proposed, selected, and organized at
        the opening of the conference. We also encourage attendees to suggest
        and discuss ideas in advance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Talks can be on any topic that is even vaguely related to technology. It
        can be on a hard technical topic or on a soft topic like "Having
        Empathy". They should be between 30 and 45 minutes long. We'll have
        projectors and a bunch of adaptors, just bring a laptop if you want to
        use them. Sessions aren't limited to talks&mdash;here are some

        relevant or that are potentially inappropriate.
